Windows 11 network share password issue
=======================================

When trying to access Windows 11 network share with MicrosoftAccount I get "Password expired" error. It's odd as I use the same MicrosoftAccount user on both computers.

## Solution

- Go to Local Users and Groups/Users.
- Open you user (it will have shorted name)
- Dissable "User must change password at nest logon"
- Enable "Password never expires"

If did not work got to Accounts/Sign-in options and dissable "only allow Windows Hello sign-in for Microsoft accounts on this device"
